# Relaxation Algorithm for Solving Continuous-Time Models
This Python code implements a relaxation algorithm to solve infinite-horizon continuous-time models<br>
## Overview
- Initialization with global parameters and settings.<br>
- Calculation of steady-state values.<br>
- Implementation of the system of ODEs.<br>
- Calculation of the final boundary conditions.<br>
- Convergence control with adjustable tolerance and maximum iterations.<br>
- Usage of higher-precision data types for numerical stability.<br>
- Calculation of eigenvalues for the Jacobian matrix.<br>
